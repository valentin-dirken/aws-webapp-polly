# Task 5: Create a convert to audio Lambda function

You now create a Lambda function that converts text that is stored in the DynamoDB table into an audio file.

1. Choose **Functions** in the top-left navigation pane.
   > **Note**: You might need to expand the navigation pane by choosing the menu icon.

2. Choose **Create function**.

3. Choose **Author from scratch** and use the following settings:
   - **Function name**: `ConvertToAudio`
   - **Runtime**: Python 3.12
   - Expand **Change default execution role**
   - **Execution role**: Choose **Use an existing role**
   - **Existing role**: Choose `Lab-Lambda-Role`

4. Scroll down and choose **Create function**.

## Add Code

Delete the existing code and paste the following code:

```python
import boto3
import os
from contextlib import closing
from boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key, Attr

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    postId = event["Records"][0]["Sns"]["Message"]

    print ("Text to Speech function. Post ID in DynamoDB: " + postId)

    # Retrieving information about the post from DynamoDB table
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table(os.environ['DB_TABLE_NAME'])
    postItem = table.query(
        KeyConditionExpression=Key('id').eq(postId)
    )


    text = postItem["Items"][0]["text"]
    voice = postItem["Items"][0]["voice"]

    rest = text

    # Because single invocation of the polly synthesize_speech api can
    # transform text with about 3000 characters, we are dividing the
    # post into blocks of approximately 2500 characters.
    textBlocks = []
    while (len(rest) > 2600):
        begin = 0
        end = rest.find(".", 2500)

        if (end == -1):
            end = rest.find(" ", 2500)

        textBlock = rest[begin:end]
        rest = rest[end:]
        textBlocks.append(textBlock)
    textBlocks.append(rest)

    # For each block, invoke Polly API, which transforms text into audio
    polly = boto3.client('polly')
    for textBlock in textBlocks:
        response = polly.synthesize_speech(
            OutputFormat='mp3',
            Text = textBlock,
            VoiceId = voice
        )

        # Save the audio stream returned by Amazon Polly on Lambda's temp
        # directory. If there are multiple text blocks, the audio stream
        # is combined into a single file.
        if "AudioStream" in response:
            with closing(response["AudioStream"]) as stream:
                output = os.path.join("/tmp/", postId)
                if os.path.isfile(output):
                    mode = "ab"  # Append binary mode
                else:
                    mode = "wb"  # Write binary mode (create a new file)
                with open(output, mode) as file:
                    file.write(stream.read())

    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.upload_file('/tmp/' + postId,
      os.environ['BUCKET_NAME'],
      postId + ".mp3")
    s3.put_object_acl(ACL='public-read',
      Bucket=os.environ['BUCKET_NAME'],
      Key= postId + ".mp3")

    location = s3.get_bucket_location(Bucket=os.environ['BUCKET_NAME'])
    region = location['LocationConstraint']

    if region is None:
        url_beginning = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/"
    else:
        url_beginning = "https://s3-" + str(region) + ".amazonaws.com/"

    url = url_beginning \
            + str(os.environ['BUCKET_NAME']) \
            + "/" \
            + str(postId) \
            + ".mp3"

    # Updating the item in DynamoDB
    response = table.update_item(
        Key={'id':postId},
          UpdateExpression=
            "SET #statusAtt = :statusValue, #urlAtt = :urlValue",
          ExpressionAttributeValues=
            {':statusValue': 'UPDATED', ':urlValue': url},
        ExpressionAttributeNames=
          {'#statusAtt': 'status', '#urlAtt': 'url'},
    )

    return
```

Examine the code. The Lambda function does the following:

- Retrieves the ID of the DynamoDB item (post ID) which should be converted into an audio file from the input message (SNS event)
- Retrieves the item from DynamoDB
- Converts the text into an audio stream
- Places the audio (MP3) file into an S3 bucket
- Updates the DynamoDB table with a reference to the S3 bucket and the new status

The `synthesize_speech` method receives the text to be converted and the voice to used. In return, it provides the audio stream. The catch is that there is a size limit of 3000 characters on the text that can be provided as input. Because a post can be big, posts need to be divided into blocks of about 2500 characters, depending where the final word in the block ends. After converting the blocks into an audio stream, they are joined together again.

Choose **Deploy**.

## Configure Environment Variables

As with the New Post function, you need to tell this Lambda function which services it can interact with via Environment variables.

1. Choose the **Configuration** tab to configure the environment variables.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Environment variables**.
3. In the Environment variables section, choose **Edit**.
4. Choose **Add environment variable**:
   - **Key**: Enter `DB_TABLE_NAME`
   - **Value**: Enter `posts_vdirken`
5. Choose **Add environment variable**:
   - **Key**: Enter `BUCKET_NAME`
   - **Value**: Enter the name of the bucket you created earlier. It should look similar to: `audioposts-vdirken`
6. Choose **Save**.

## Configure Timeout Settings

The posts to be converted can be quite big, so you need to extend the maximum time of a single code execution to 5 minutes.

1. In the General configuration section, choose **Edit**.
2. Update the **Timeout** to **5 minutes**.
3. Choose **Save**.

## Configure Trigger

You now configure the function to trigger automatically when a message is sent to the SNS topic that you created earlier.

1. In the Triggers section, choose **Add trigger** and then configure:
   - **Select a source**: SNS
   - **SNS topic**: Select `new_posts_vdirken` from available topics.
2. Choose **Add**.

You are now ready to test that the two Lambda functions communicate successfully via SNS and create a Polly audio file.

## Task Complete
You can now proceed to the next task.
