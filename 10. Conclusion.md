# Conclusion

You have successfully done the following:

- Created an Amazon DynamoDB table to store data
- Created an Amazon API Gateway RESTful API
- Created AWS Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway
- Connected AWS Lambda functions with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- Used Amazon Polly to synthesize speech in a variety of languages and voices

In this lab, you created an application that converts text into speech in dozens of languages and voices. Although the application converts blog posts into speech, it can be used for many other purposes, such as converting text on websites or adding speech functionality to web applications.

The application is completely serverless. There are no servers to maintain or patch. By default, the application is highly available because AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB use multiple Available Zones.

So now what? Use this approach to imagine and build new applications that provide a much better user experience than previously possible.
