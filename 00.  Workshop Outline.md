# 00. School19 - Workshop Outline

## Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

- Create an Amazon DynamoDB table to store data
- Create an Amazon API Gateway RESTful API
- Create AWS Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway
- Connect AWS Lambda functions with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- Use Amazon Polly to synthesize speech in a variety of languages and voices

## Duration
This workshop requires approximately 90 minutes to complete.

## Workshop environment
You build a serverless application, which means that you do not need to work with servers — no provisioning, no patching, no scaling. The AWS Cloud automatically takes care of this, allowing you to focus on your application.

The application provides two methods – one for sending information about a new post, which should be converted into an MP3 file, and one for retrieving information about the post (including a link to the MP3 file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket). Both methods are exposed as RESTful web services through Amazon API Gateway.

### When the application sends information about new posts:

1. The information is received by the RESTful web service exposed by Amazon API Gateway. This web service is invoked by a static webpage hosted on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

2. Amazon API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function, New Post, which is responsible for initializing the process of generating MP3 files.

3. The Lambda function inserts information about the post into an Amazon DynamoDB table, where information about all posts is stored.

4. To run the whole process asynchronously, you use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to decouple the process of receiving information about new posts and starting their audio conversion.

5. Another Lambda function, Convert to Audio, is subscribed to your SNS topic and is triggered whenever a new message appears (which means that a new post should be converted into an audio file).

6. The Convert to Audio Lambda function uses Amazon Polly to convert the text into an audio file in the specified language (the same as the language of the text).

7. The new MP3 file is saved in a dedicated S3 bucket.

8. Information about the post is updated in the DynamoDB table. The URL to the audio file stored in the S3 bucket is saved with the previously stored data.

### When the application retrieves information about posts:

1. The RESTful web service is deployed using Amazon API Gateway. Amazon API Gateway exposes the method for retrieving information about posts. These methods contain the text of the post and the link to the S3 bucket where the MP3 file is stored. The web service is invoked by a static webpage hosted on Amazon S3.

2. Amazon API Gateway invokes the Get Post Lambda function, which deploys the logic for retrieving the post data.

3. The Get Post Lambda function retrieves information about the post (including the reference to Amazon S3) from the DynamoDB table and returns the information.
