### Task 3: Create an SNS Topic

As you probably noticed in the architecture diagram, the logic of converting a post (text) into an audio file is split into two AWS Lambda functions. This was done for a couple of reasons.

First, it allows the application to use asynchronous calls so that the user who sends a new post to the application immediately receives the ID of the new DynamoDB item, so it knows what to ask for later without having to wait for the conversion to finish. With small posts, the process of converting to audio files can take milliseconds, but with bigger posts (100,000 words or more), converting the text can take longer. In other use cases, such as real-time streaming, size is not a problem because Amazon Polly starts to stream speech back as soon as the first bytes are available.

Second, the system uses a Lambda function to convert the posts.

Given that the process has been divided into two processes, there needs to be a way to integrate them together. You use Amazon SNS to send the message about the new post from the first function to the second function.

1. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose **Simple Notification Service**.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Topics**.
   - **Note**: You might need to expand the navigation pane by choosing the menu icon.
3. Choose **Create topic** and configure the following details:
   - **Type**: Choose **Standard**
   - **Name**: `new_posts_vdirken`
   - **Display name**: `New Posts vdirken`
4. At the bottom of the page, choose **Create topic**.
5. Copy the **Topic ARN** and paste it into a text editor for later use. (eg;  `arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:new_posts`)


   **Note**: You configure the Lambda functions to use this Topic ARN later in the lab.

**Task Complete**

You can now proceed to the next task.
