# Task 6: Test the functions

You now test the following workflow:

1. Manually trigger the New Post Lambda function
2. It stores data in DynamoDB and sends a message to the SNS topic
3. SNS triggers the Convert To Audio function, which uses Polly to create an audio file and store it in the S3 bucket

## Test the Functions

1. Choose **Functions** in the top-left corner.
   > **Note**: You might need to expand the navigation pane by choosing the menu icon.

2. Choose **PostReader_NewPost** function.

3. Choose **Test**.

4. You should see the message: **Execution result: succeeded**.

This indicates that this function was executed. You now confirm that the other steps have also completed successfully.

## Check DynamoDB for Records

1. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose **DynamoDB**.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Explore items**.

3. Choose **posts**.

4. You should see two entries because you have run the test twice. The second execution should have also triggered the Convert to Audio Lambda function, so there is also an entry for the url.

## Check Lambda Monitoring

1. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose **Lambda**.

2. Choose the **ConvertToAudio** function.

3. Choose the **Monitor** tab.

4. The monitoring charts should indicate that the function has been invoked.

> **Warning**
> If the Error count and success rate chart indicates that an error occurred, then you need to investigate the error:
> 
> - Choose **View CloudWatch logs**
> - Choose the Log Stream shown in the list
> - Expand the log entries to discover the error message
> 
> For example, if you received the error *The specified bucket does not exist*, then you need to confirm that the bucket name you entered in the Environment variables matches the name of the S3 bucket you created earlier in the lab.

## Check S3 for the Audio File

If Convert to Audio function executed successfully, there should be an MP3 file in your S3 bucket.

1. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose **S3**.

2. Choose your **audioposts-** bucket.

3. You should see an MP3 file. Download it and listen to the contents â€” you should hear Polly's Joanna voice saying "This is working!"

## Task Complete
You can now proceed to the next task.
