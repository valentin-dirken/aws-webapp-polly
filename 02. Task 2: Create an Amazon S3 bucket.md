### Task 2: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket

You need to create an Amazon S3 bucket to store all audio files created by the application. You create a bucket with a unique name, such as `audioposts-123456789`.

1. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose **S3**.
2. Choose **Create bucket** and configure the following details:
   - **Bucket name**: `audioposts-USERNAME`
     - Replace `USERNAME` with your username (e.g.; vdirken).
   - Copy the name of your bucket to your text editor as you will use the bucket name later.
   - Under **Object Ownership**, choose **ACLs enabled**.
   - Under **Block Public Access settings for this bucket**, deselect the **Block all public access** option, and then leave all other options deselected.

   **Note**: Notice all of the individual options remain deselected. When deselecting all public access, you must then select the individual options that apply to your situation and security objectives. In a production environment, it is recommended to use the least permissive settings possible.

   A warning box appears saying that: Turning off block all public access might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public. AWS recommends that you turn on block all public access, unless public access is required for specific and verified use cases such as static website hosting.

3. Select the check box next to **I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public**.
4. Choose **Create bucket**.

   **Note**: Every Amazon S3 bucket must have a unique name.

   **Caution**: If you receive an error stating "The requested bucket name is not available", select the top **Edit** link, change the bucket name, and try again until it works.

**Task Complete**
